# Deep Learning roject

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning project created as part of a Final Assessment Task (FAT). The project demonstrates advanced neural network design and training, showcasing key concepts in deep learning.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to [briefly describe the main objective of your project, e.g., "classify images, predict trends, detect objects, etc."].

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Describe the dataset, e.g., "Images dataset from CIFAR-10 or tabular data from Kaggle."]
- **Description**: [Provide details such as the number of records, key features, and target variable.]
- **Preprocessing**: [List preprocessing techniques applied to the data.]

## Methods and Techniques

- **Neural Network Architecture**:
  - Model type: [e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), etc.]
  - Key layers and configurations: [e.g., "Three convolutional layers, batch normalization, and max pooling."]
- **Frameworks and Tools**: [e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy.]
- **Training**:
  - Loss function: [e.g., Categorical Crossentropy.]
  - Optimizer: [e.g., Adam.]
  - Training epochs and batch size: [e.g., "10 epochs with a batch size of 32."]

## Results

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - [e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, or Mean Squared Error.]
- **Visualizations**:
  - Include graphs or charts generated during the project (e.g., training vs. validation accuracy, confusion matrix).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DeepLearning_Project.git
   cd DeepLearning_Project
